<body>

<p>This Java project aims at providing a Maven 2 plugin which convert 
<a href="http://argouml.trigris.org/">ArgoUML UML models</a> to 
<a href="http://modello.codehaus.org/">Modello model files.</a></p>
<p>By combining ArgoUML and the Modello code generator, this plugin
 allow to generate SQL DDL files (databases structures), Java beans, XML reader 
 and writer (for several APIs: JDOM, Xpp3, Stax [the preferred since it allow to
 maintain references of objects, which is useful for bidirectional associations]),
 XSD and DTD grammars from a UML model.
</p>

<p>The plugin target the following softwares:</p>

<ul>
<li>Modello (1.0.1) (+ unreleased patchs for supporting annotations and default imports. The plugin cannot function without these patchs applied!)</li>
<li>ArgoUML (0.28 - trunk)</li>
<!-- 
<li>You can add a "Highlights:" line to the top of all web pages by adding a file www/project_highlights.html </li>

</ul>

<h3>Mission</h3>

<p>This plugin convert UML model to Modello models at the <strong>process-sources</strong> phase.</p>

<p>Here is a sample usage:</p>
<pre>
&lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd"&gt;
...
  &lt;build&gt;
    &lt;plugins&gt;
      &lt;plugin&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;com.ubikproducts.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-argo2modello-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;executions&gt;
          &lt;execution&gt;
            &lt;id&gt;generate-modello&lt;/id&gt;
            &lt;phase&gt;generate-sources&lt;/phase&gt;
            &lt;goals&gt;
              &lt;goal&gt;generate-modello&lt;/goal&gt;
            &lt;/goals&gt;
          &lt;/execution&gt;
        &lt;/executions&gt;
        &lt;configuration&gt;
          &lt;sourceModel&gt;src/main/models/users.uml&lt;/sourceModel&gt;
          &lt;destinationModel&gt;src/main/models/users.mdo&lt;/destinationModel&gt;
          &lt;defaultImports&gt;javax.persistence.*,javax.xml.bind.annotation.*&lt;/defaultImports&gt;
        &lt;/configuration&gt;
      &lt;/plugin&gt;

p>What is the scope of this project?
</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Develop just enough functionality to scratch a particular itch</li>
<li>Build a tool just like XYZ, but less broken</li>
<li>Build the best XYZ-tool ever!</li>
</ul>


<p>What are high-level features you are sure to build?
</p>
<ul>

<li>What would you write on a billboard about your project? Users
might only look for a few seconds.</li>

<li>Use the issue tracker to track features and enhancement
requests. It is not just for bugs, pre-populate it with feature
descriptions so that potential contributors know what you would like them
to work on.</li>
</ul>

<p>What are the high-level assumptions or ground rules for the project?
</p>

<p>For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li> we will use programming language X on operating system Y for now.

<li>We will, or will not, consider certain functional areas like
internationalization, high security, concurrency, etc.  The list of
functional areas will depend on what you are trying to do.

<li>Try to keep this part short.
</ul>


<h3>Related resources</h3>

<ul>
<li>Link to other stuff that you know about.  It will help you
research requirements and provide a useful resource to potential
contributors.</li>

<li>Why reinvent the wheel? What is better about this wheel?  Is there
any existing project that you can partner with or reuse?</li>

<li>Where would you go to try to find potential contibutors?</li>
</ul>
 -->
<h3>Todos</h3>

<p>The plugin should support the following features for the version 1.0 to be released:</p>
<ul>
<li>inheritance</li>
<li>interfaces</li>
<li>methods and methods body</li>
<li>inplace of update of existing modello files</li>
<li>roundtrip editing (with the help of the modello-uml-plugin)</li>
</ul>
