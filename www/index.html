<body>

<p>This Java project aims at providing a Maven 2 plugin which convert 
<a href="http://argouml.trigris.org/">ArgoUML UML models</a> to 
<a href="http://modello.codehaus.org/">Modello model files.</a></p>
<p>By combining ArgoUML and the Modello code generator, this plugin
 allow to generate SQL DDL files (databases structures), Java beans, XML reader 
 and writer (for several APIs: JDOM, Xpp3, Stax [the preferred since it allow to
 maintain references of objects, which is useful for bidirectional associations]),
 XSD and DTD grammars from a UML model.
</p>

<p>The plugin target the following softwares:</p>

<ul>
<li>Modello (1.0-alpha-19-SNAPSHOT)</li>
<li>ArgoUML (0.25.4 binary)</li>
<!-- 
<li>You can add a "Highlights:" line to the top of all web pages by adding a file www/project_highlights.html </li>

<h3>Mission</h3>

<p>This plugin convert UML model to Modello models at the <strong>process-sources</strong> phase.</p>

p>What is the scope of this project?
</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Develop just enough functionality to scratch a particular itch</li>
<li>Build a tool just like XYZ, but less broken</li>
<li>Build the best XYZ-tool ever!</li>
</ul>


<p>What are high-level features you are sure to build?
</p>
<ul>

<li>What would you write on a billboard about your project? Users
might only look for a few seconds.</li>

<li>Use the issue tracker to track features and enhancement
requests. It is not just for bugs, pre-populate it with feature
descriptions so that potential contributors know what you would like them
to work on.</li>
</ul>

<p>What are the high-level assumptions or ground rules for the project?
</p>

<p>For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li> we will use programming language X on operating system Y for now.

<li>We will, or will not, consider certain functional areas like
internationalization, high security, concurrency, etc.  The list of
functional areas will depend on what you are trying to do.

<li>Try to keep this part short.
</ul>


<h3>Related resources</h3>

<ul>
<li>Link to other stuff that you know about.  It will help you
research requirements and provide a useful resource to potential
contributors.</li>

<li>Why reinvent the wheel? What is better about this wheel?  Is there
any existing project that you can partner with or reuse?</li>

<li>Where would you go to try to find potential contibutors?</li>
</ul>
